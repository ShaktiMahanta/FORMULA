# Problem with solution

### Missing in Array

You are given an array arr of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

```text filename="Missing no an Array" {3} copy

    Example:
    Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    Example:
    Input: arr[] = [8, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 1]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: All the numbers from 1 to 8 are present except 6.

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    Example:
    Input: arr[] = [1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Only 1 is present so the missing element is 2.




```

To solve this problem use this formula.

    Sum=n×(n+1)​/2


    Steps:
    1.Compute the expected sum of the sequence 1 to n.
    2.Compute the actual sum of the elements in the array.
    3.The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum gives the missing number.

```java filename="" {3} copy

    class MissingNumber {
    public static int findMissingNumber(int[] arr) {
        int length = arr.length +1;
        int sumofNumbers = (length*(length + 1))/2;

        int arrDefault=0;

        for(int sumofArrayNumber : arr){
            arrDefault = arrDefault + sumofArrayNumber;
        }

        int missingNumberIs = sumofNumbers - arrDefault;

        return missingNumberIs;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 5};
        System.out.println("The missing number is: " + findMissingNumber(arr));
    }
}


```
