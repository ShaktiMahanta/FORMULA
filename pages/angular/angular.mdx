# Two-way Binding

Two-Way Binding

    1.Definition:
        Automatically synchronizes data between the model and the view in both directions. Changes in the UI update the model, and changes in the model reflect in the UI.

    2.Mechanism:
        Requires a framework or library that listens for changes in both the model and the view.

    ``` html fileName="a.html" {3} copy
        Angular (using [(ngModel)]):

        <input [(ngModel)]="name" />
        <p>Hello, {{ name }}</p>
    ```

            If the user types in the input, the name variable updates automatically.
            If the name variable changes programmatically, the input field updates.

    3.Use Case:
        Scenarios where the user input directly affects the application state, such as forms.

    4.Advantages:
        Simplifies handling of user input.
        Reduces boilerplate code for updating the view and model.

    5.Disadvantages:
        Harder to debug as changes can occur in multiple places.
        Can lead to performance issues in large applications due to constant syncing.
